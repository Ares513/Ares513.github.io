                  <p>I have a wide variety of internship experience. I've completed internships at Angelo, Gordon & Co, Vistaprint, the US Coast Guard and Raytheon BBN Technologies. I used Python and C# during my internships.</p>
                  <p>In my free time, I work on a variety of projects. A few highlights include a neural net for detecting Russian troll tweets, a healthcare advocacy website, and a data visualization of police militarization.

                  <h3>Jonathan Brecher<br> Principal Software Engineer at Cimpress</h3>
                  <p><i>Evan exceeded our expectations during his internship at Vistaprint in the Summer of 2017. In his first week it was clear that he already had a firm understanding of object-oriented principles and good code design, both subjects that we normally expect to have to teach over the course of the internship period. From that strong base, he quickly picked up several technologies (for example including LINQ) that he had not experienced before, learning them quickly and using them properly as he continued his tasks.

Evan clearly has a very strong interest in how his activities fit into the bigger picture. As he learned more about the complex domain that he was working on, he was able to refine his code based on his increased understanding.

Ironically, my biggest concerns about Evan’s activities also stemmed directly from his enthusiasm. It was a challenge to get him to slow down and take a breath. He always wanted to do more. That isn’t a bad thing, when it comes down to it. And Evan improved in this regard as well, dividing his thoughts into smaller pieces as time progressed, and generating even better code as a result.

Evan's code will serve as a strong base for continued work moving forward.</i></p>

                  <p><i>Evan was my intern over the summer of 2017, and I worked closely with him for 2.5 months he was here. During that time, I found him to be articulate, inquisitive, outcome-focused, and a very quick learner. His aptitude is very high, and is matched by his desire to always be better.

It was a privilege to observe and participate in Evan's growth as a developer in the few short weeks here. He worked in a challenging domain, implementing a maintainable solution to a complex sequencing problem using stochastic approaches. (Specifically genetic algorithm and particle swarm.)

Evan came in on Day 1 with the ability to express a complex ideas in code without getting stuck, which is unusual for an intern. A few weeks later, those same ideas were hidden behind maintainable, testable abstractions. Evan is quick to take useful feedback in one area, and apply it to all other areas. He is thorough, and will ask questions until he understands an idea completely, and is convinced of its merit. I found that this had a tendency to expose weaknesses in my own understanding, which was wonderful.

Evan's project was successful, and his presentation was the benchmark for this intern class, in my opinion. He values clear communication, and gives enough context to understand, but not so much as to overwhelm.

Evan would be an incredible asset to any strong team. He wants to stand out, and he wants his team to stand out with him. In addition to being a great developer, Evan's a hell of a nice guy, and I hope to work again with him in the future.</i></p>
